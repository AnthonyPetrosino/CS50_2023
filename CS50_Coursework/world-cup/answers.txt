Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The idea that 10x more simulations took 10x more amount of time in each instance.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I would say after 10000 simulations since the outputs are consistently similar to those of
the programs that run more simulations.
