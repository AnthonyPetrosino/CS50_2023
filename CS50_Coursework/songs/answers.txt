If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

The audio aura would likely represent the users prefered average energy, valence, and danceability levels.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

This might not mean much because it is only representative of their top 100 songs, which may not represent
certain preferences. The data collected may also be outdated and the listener's tastes may have changed.
